# hello-world
This is my first foray into github 
I've been interested in programming since I took a programming course as an elective in college but I was unable to make the switch from my major to CS due to a lack of a strong CS department at my school. 
Now that I'm a few years out of college and am gaining work experience in a field that fits with my original major, I'm attempting to learn again. I've got the time now and I can finally breathe easy regarding my life plans, so I figure it's better late than never!
